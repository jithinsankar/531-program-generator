# 5/3/1 Workout Program generator 🏋🏽

The 5/3/1 workout program is one of the most effective strength training systems, focusing on core compound lifts like the squat, deadlift, bench press, and overhead press. Designed by Jim Wendler, this program uses calculated percentages of your Training Max (TM) to ensure progressive overload and consistent gains over time.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
